# Create API Gem

Welcome to the Create API Gem! This gem provides a way of interacting with [Typeforms Create API](https://developer.typeform.com/create/) if you are programming in Ruby. We have created object representations of forms, themes, images, workspaces and teams so you can programmatically create all of the afore mentioned using Ruby nice and easily. Also you'll find all the requests needed to perform CRUD operations on each of these entities.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'create_api_gem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install create_api_gem

## Usage

Let's say you want to create a form.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
